=> Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.
