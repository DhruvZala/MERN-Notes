Node.js is an open source server environment.
Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server.

Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js 
to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that 
listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.

var http = require('http');

*create a server object:
    http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        res.write('Hello World!'); //write a response to the client
        res.end(); //end the response
    }).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080

If the response from the HTTP server is supposed to be displayed as HTML,
 you should include an HTTP header with the correct content type.
